These structures are based on [Evan Jones structures](https://github.com/evanj/tpccbench/blob/master/tpccdb.h)

We can convert to storing in records using the [struct conversion](struct_conversion.h) which casts the structure to char buffers.

To include them all simply include [tpcc_record_types.h](tpcc_record_types.h)
